I studied Docker today. There were some terms I didn't understand while studying, so I researched them as well.
I realized there is still a lot to learn.
In the evening, I joined a category theory meeting that I had been interested in for a while.
It was a difficult topic for me but also interesting.
So I'm also looking forward to the next meeting.
