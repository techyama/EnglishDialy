I was too tired from work today, so I didn't go to the gym.
Instead, I installed and tried Cursor, which has been becoming a trand lately.
My impression is that it feels almost the same as VSCode and is very user-friendly.
The evolution of AI is incredible, and I want to keep up so I don't get left behind.
