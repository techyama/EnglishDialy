Today, I was able to make progress on my work.
Having just joined the project, I didn't have a good understanding of the system.
By reading the code and communicating with team members, I gradually began to understand the specifications.
I might be able to make even more progress on my tasks than I did today.
I'll do my best again tomorrow!
