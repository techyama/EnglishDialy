I tried to develop with TailwindCSS and React.js.
Until now, I have learned how to use TailwindCSS and React.js to develop a simple web application.
Problem occurred as soon as I started development.
The style wasn't applied, and it took 3 hours to get it right.
The solution was very simple, I just needed to reboot the frontend server.
I said "Damn it!"
