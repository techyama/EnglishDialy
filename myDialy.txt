Today is my first day studying English with GitHub.
It's more challenging than I expected, but also more enjoyable!
By the way, I wanted to go to the gym as usual, but I gave up because it started raining.
I wish it were closer, but it takes more than 15 minutes to walk there.
I hope it's sunny tomorrow.
