Today, I worked on creating materials for my presentation.
Someone I recently got to know in a community I joined asked me to give a presentation,
so I'll be presenting soon. I'm really excited because it's a great opportunity for more people
to get to know me.
I want to prepare thoroughly to ensure I can deliver an excellent presentation.
